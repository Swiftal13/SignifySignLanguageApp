Machine learning with tensorflow, kaggle for dataset, and huggingface for the model
so looking online at school 
- i can make my own model but i need to train it myself.
- people say models take long to make up to a few weeks, so i would have to make a designated model by january
- i could aws to not only to train the model with the dataset on there but peformthe ML prcoesses linked there and return result back to request
