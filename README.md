**Machine learning with tensorflow, kaggle for dataset, and huggingface for the model**
so looking online at school 
- i can make my own model but i need to train it myself.
- people say models take long to make up to a few weeks, so i would have to make a designated model by january
- i could aws to not only to train the model with the dataset on there but peformthe ML prcoesses linked there and return result back to request

I could use a pretrained made model from hugging face. But whats the point of that, the people there want you to use machine learning neural networks, and make your own.

I need to research. - 

**- AWS services or google cloud**
- making my own NN
- figure out the purpose of this program
